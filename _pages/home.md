<h2>About me</h2>

Hi! I am a postdoctoral research fellow in the Biostatistics Department of the University of Michigan, under the supervision of Dr. [Irina Gaynanova](https://irinagain.github.io/).

I'm generally interested in analyzing complex data encountered in practice. My recent research focuses on distributional data approaches for wearable device data, specifically continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices. I also have a strong interest in compositional data analysis where I have worked on dimension reduction methods for microbiome data during my Ph.D. studies.

 <!--In my Ph.D. work, I have primarily worked on *compositional data analysis*, including variable selection, interpretable dimension reduction, and predictive model development. I've also started working on continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data with Dr. Gaynanova. -->

 <!-- interested in developing methods for nonnegative data, functional data, and tensor data analysis. On the theoretical side, I am interested in kernel conditional mean embedding, sufficient dimension reduction, and high-dimensional statistics. -->

I earned my Ph.D. in Mathematical Sciences, specializing in compositional data analysis and statistical learning, under the guidance of Professors [Cheolwoo Park](https://sites.google.com/view/parkcw/home?authuser) and [Jeongyoun Ahn](https://statds.kaist.ac.kr/professor). Before working on statistics, I conducted research in algebraic geometry under the supervision of Professor Sijong Kwak until the summer of 2021.

I enjoy coffee :coffee:, :wine_glass:, running, and singing :).

Here is my [CV](/assets/CV.pdf) (last updated: Nov 2024)
