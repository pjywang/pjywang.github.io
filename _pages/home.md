<h2>About me</h2>

Hi! I am a postdoctoral research fellow in the Department of Mathematical Sciences at KAIST, supported by the BK21 project in Korea. Starting in September 2024, I will join the University of Michigan as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the Department of Biostatistics, under the mentorship of Professor Irina Gaynanova. I earned my Ph.D. in Mathematical Sciences, specializing in compositional data analysis and statistical learning, under the guidance of Professors [Cheolwoo Park](https://sites.google.com/view/parkcw/home?authuser) and [Jeongyoun Ahn](https://statds.kaist.ac.kr/professor). Additionally, I conducted research in algebraic geometry under the supervision of Professor Sijong Kwak until the summer of 2021.

I have primarily worked on *compositional data analysis*, including variable selection, interpretable dimension reduction, and predictive model development. I am also interested in developing methods for nonnegative data, functional data, and tensor data analysis. On the theoretical side, I am interested in kernel conditional mean embedding, sufficient dimension reduction, and high-dimensional statistics.

I enjoy coffee :coffee:, :wine_glass:, running, and singing :).

Here is my [CV](/assets/CV.pdf) (last updated: May 2024)
