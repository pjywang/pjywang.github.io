<h2>About</h2>

I am a Ph.D. candidate in the department of Mathematical Sciences at KAIST, studying statistical learning and data sciences. I am currently advised by [Cheolwoo Park](https://sites.google.com/view/parkcw/home?authuser) and [Jeongyoun Ahn](https://statds.kaist.ac.kr/professor). Before switching to the current field, I studied algebraic geometry under Prof. Sijong Kwak up to 2021.

Since 2021, I have been primarily working on **compositional data analysis**, including variable selection, representation learning, and sufficient dimension reduction via kernel methods. I am also broadly interested in analyzing various unstructured data, especially non-Euclidean data.

Here is my [CV](/assets/CV.pdf)
